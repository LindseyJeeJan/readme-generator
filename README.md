  ## Description
  A complete README file allows you to introduce yourself to the users of your application and to connect with other developers. An incomplete README file can leave others with questions about how to use your application. I wanted to ensure a consistent and complete README file is included in every project. This application uses Node.js, npm and inquirer.js package.
